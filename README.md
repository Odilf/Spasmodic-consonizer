# Spasmodic-consonizer
A fuzzy consonance analyser written in Julia. 

I named it spasmodic because it is a fun word. It is meant to convey that ratios don't have to be perfect. 

# How to run

It is a [Pluto notebook](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl), which you'll need to get up and running after installing [Julia](https://julialang.org).
